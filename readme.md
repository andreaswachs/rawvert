# rawvert

If you've pulled out your images of Apple's Photos app and have raw images therein you can convert them to JPG and move them at the same time. 

This has been made to accomodate my needs. It is not so distribution friendly, so dive in the code to make sure it works for your needs.

## Usage:
For converting a single folder:

`python rawvert.py -s <folder-name>`

For converting a whole subfolder:

`python rawvert.py -w <folder-name>`

Optional --test for moving the images into a test directory, to separate them from your other images.
